Description: Variance-stabilizing transformations (VST) help with the analysis of 
  heteroskedastic data (i.e., data where the variance is not constant). For Gamma-Poisson
  count data, the variance grows quadratically with the mean. Traditional VSTs, however,
  struggle to stabilize small counts. Residual-based VSTs overcome this problem by 
  sharing information across samples.
